Write more tests
  o unify
    o pattern_ge
  o ifmatch

Adapt/import
  o pdispatch

Refactor
  o Consider how to organize and divide nodepatterns.jl

Add
  o VectorPattern
    ==> test  - circular patterns and values
              - identity vs VectorPattern conformance

Minor:
  o Allow multiple let arguments to @ifmatch let


Bigger picture:
  o get @ifmatch and pdispatch to work with TupplePattern and VectorPattern
  ==> start on
    o questionaire system for more diverse patterns
    o generation of merged dispatch code
